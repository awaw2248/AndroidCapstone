## Link to wireframes and user stories:
_**User Story**: As a user of to-do-app, the need to simplfiy the process of adding and deleting tasks must be simple and easy enough so that it becomes not a task itself._ 

## Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy:
 _**Planning** 
 for a to-do-application was done through doing research about the application. Spcifically, looking at current to-do-applications at Google Play store._
 _**Development process**
 This is done through applying basic Android Koltin concepts which listed above._
 _**Problem-Solving Strategy**
 My problem solving strategy involved utilizing resources available at Tuwaiq Academy. Also, reviewing how Android kotlin concepts are being used as well as looking the problem up at the internet for clues._
 
## Describe how some of your favorite functions work:
1. **View/Update Todo** *The user is able to view tasks and update them anytime*
1. **Create Todo** *The user is able to create a Task anytime easily and set a Due date for accomplishment*
2. **Delete existing Todo** *The user does also have the ability to delete any task wheather accomplished or not*
4. **Visibility of Creation Date** *The app displays creation date for users anytime they set a task to be accomplished.* 
5. **Indication for Accomblished Tasks** *The app indicate to users when due dates passed due by a red color change.*

## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations:
1. _The **design** can be improved more to be more user friendly_
2. _More **features** can be added like setting the **priority**, **filtering** by dates of tasks and many others._
3. _The **code** could be more clean with future iterations._
4. _Google maps feature can be added._
